This repository showcases the integration between **Agent Voice Response** and **Deepgram's Speech-to-Speech API**. The application leverages Deepgram's powerful speech processing capabilities to provide intelligent, context-aware responses in real-time audio format.

## Prerequisites

To set up and run this project, you will need:

1. **Node.js** and **npm** installed
2. A **Deepgram API key** with access to the Speech-to-Speech API
3. **WebSocket** support in your environment

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentvoiceresponse/avr-sts-deepgram.git
cd avr-sts-deepgram
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project to store your API keys and configuration. You will need to add the following variables:

```bash
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
PORT=6033
```

Replace `your_deepgram_api_key` with your actual Deepgram API key.

### 4. Running the Application

Start the application by running the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

The server will start on the port defined in the environment variable (default: 6033).

## How It Works

The **Agent Voice Response** system integrates with Deepgram's Speech-to-Speech API to provide intelligent audio-based responses to user queries. The server receives audio input from users, forwards it to Deepgram's API, and then returns the model's response as audio in real-time using WebSocket communication.

### Key Components

- **Express.js Server**: Handles incoming audio streams from clients
- **WebSocket Communication**: Manages real-time communication with Deepgram's API
- **Audio Processing**: Handles audio format conversion and streaming
- **Real-time Streaming**: Processes and streams audio data in real-time

### Audio Processing

The application is configured to work with:
- **Input Audio**: 16-bit PCM at 8kHz
- **Output Audio**: 16-bit PCM at 8kHz
- **Encoding**: Linear16 format

## API Endpoints

### POST `/speech-to-speech-stream`

This endpoint accepts an audio stream and returns a streamed audio response generated by Deepgram.

**Request:**
- Content-Type: audio/x-raw
- Format: 16-bit PCM at 8kHz
- Method: POST

**Response:**
- Content-Type: text/event-stream
- Format: 16-bit PCM at 8kHz
- Streamed audio data in real-time

## Customizing the Application

### Environment Variables

You can customize the application behavior using the following environment variables:

- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`: Your Deepgram API key (required)
- `PORT`: The port on which the server will listen (default: 6033)

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- WebSocket connection issues
- Audio processing errors
- Deepgram API errors
- Stream processing errors

All errors are logged to the console and appropriate error messages are returned to the client.
